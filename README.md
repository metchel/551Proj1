# COMP 551 Project 1
The first MiniProject for COMP 551 @ McGill University.

### Background
Using linear regression we were able to predict the popularity of comments on [Reddit](Reddit.com).
The goal is to make a AI that will take a comment and accuratly predict how popular it will be. 

### Running the project

To run the project with the test data python and pip are both required.

To install pip:

```
apt install python-pip 
```

Then download the repository and install the required files:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then navigate to the directory and run:
```
python3 src/descent.py
```

### TODO:
  - Implement ability to predict comment popularity directly from Reddit. 
  - Show result in a more user friendly way
